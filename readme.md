_________________________________________________________________________

My name is Jamie Forstman and I am a current middle school science & computer science teacher.  While teaching computer science, I fell in love with coding and took the leap into a bootcamp program to become a full-stack developer.  I am currently taking a full-stack web development certification program through MIT xPro to learn new skills.  When I am finished with my certification, I plan to work part-time freelance developing projects at first and then transition into a full-time full-stack developer.
